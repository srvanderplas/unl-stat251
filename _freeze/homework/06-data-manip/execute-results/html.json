To do this, they assemble reliable data about a variety of global variables to help educate the general public.\n\nI have collected data from Gapminder about several variables: \n\n- Population\n- GDP Per Capita (inflation-adjusted US dollars)\n- Mean Household Income\n- CO2 emissions (tonnes per capita)\n- Energy Use (Kg of Oil-equivalent per capita)\n\nUse the data manipulation tools you've learned about to answer each of the following questions, which I've grouped into several general topics. Some questions may specify a specific language to use; if no language is specified, you may choose whether to use R or python to answer the question.\n\n## Read In the Data\n\nRead in the data in R and Python. In both languages, store the table in the variable `gapminder`. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='06-data-manip_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-4_1737465d8040b9203c2577bff9a3a588'}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## Data Exploration\n\n### Missingness\n\nGapminder puts a lot of effort into curating certain variables; other variables are less frequently used (or are harder to assemble from reliable sources). \n\n#### CO2\nCreate a table of all countries with at least 30 observations CO2. Your table should be called `co2_sum` and should have columns `country` and `n_obs`. Do not print out the table; instead, if you have done everything correctly, when your document is compiled the correct number of countries will be filled in in the sentence below the code chunk.\n\n<!-- Use R -->\n::: {.cell hash='06-data-manip_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-5_ac6ba0c2099294e2e69f441e7e778440'}\n\n:::\n\nThere are 0 countries with at least 30 years of CO2 data.\n\n#### Energy\nAnswer in Python\n\n::: {.cell hash='06-data-manip_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-6_ef0b7f174fbf91886501472e54f16bdb'}\n\n:::\n\n\n#### Income\n\n#### GDP\n\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='06-data-manip_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-7_4ab8a824836e2d0856abdf92f334dbb6'}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\nrm ./gapminder_data.csv\n```\n:::\n",
