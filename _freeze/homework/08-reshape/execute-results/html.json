If you want, you can use paper/pencil sketches, but the images should be provided in PNG or JPEG format and included in your document as images. If you prefer a digital tool, Excalidraw.com is an excellent (free) option.\n\n# Breed Traits\n\nIs the `breed_traits.csv` file in tidy form? Why or why not? \n\nIf you wanted to plot the distribution of rankings for each trait, with each trait's distribution in a separate facet, what form would you need to use for the data?\n\n\nSketch the form the data would look like to create the necessary plot, and include the image of that sketch here.\n\nWhat transformations are necessary for the data to be converted into this form? Include a sketch of the transformation process.\n\nTransform the data and generate a plot showing the distribution of breed rankings for the variables `Affectionate With Family`, `Good with Young Children`, `Good With Other Dogs`, `Playfulness Level`, and `Trainability Level`. Each variable should have its own facet.\n\n::: {.cell hash='08-reshape_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-2_436c92197c206b659ef33a6d770f92f5'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Transformation code here\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell hash='08-reshape_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-3_cf14dfc24b40dfa2ec8c2a4a8183d7b7'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Plot code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n# Breed Ranks\n\nIs the `breed_rank_all.csv` file in tidy form? Why or why not?\n\nIf you wanted to plot the popularity of Beagles and Jack Russell Terriers between 2013 and 2020, what form would you need the data to be in?\n\n\nSketch the form the data would look like to create the necessary plot, and include the image of that sketch here.\n\nWhat transformations are necessary for the data to be converted into this form? Include a sketch of the transformation process.\n\nChoose two dog breeds that you are interested in and generate a line chart showing the breeds' relative popularity between 2013 and 2020. Breed should be indicated by color as well as linetype (so that your plot is double encoded).\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='08-reshape_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-4_d0dd06ff48d74807952f1c2c84f89752'}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\n# Transformation code here\n\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell hash='08-reshape_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-5_4a19651f770951cfff3f842f2f3bfc15'}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\n# Plot code here\n\n```\n:::\n\n\n",
