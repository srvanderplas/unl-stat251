You may show more than one variable in a single plot (latitude and longitude should probably be shown together). \nYou may use either R or python for this task.\n\n`groundhogs.csv`\n\n  - lat, long\n  - country\n  - isGroundhog\n  - active\n  - predictionsCount\n\n`predictions.csv`\n\n  - isGroundhog\n  - year\n  - shadow\n\nFor each plot you draw, write 1-2 sentences explaining what you can learn from the plot.\n\n\n```{}\n\n```\n\nThis plot shows...\n\n\n\n## Grammar of Graphics\n\nThink of a good way to answer the following questions with a plot. For each plot, write 1-2 sentences explaining why you mapped each variable in the way that you did. Use ggplot2 for this portion of the assignment.\n\nYou may make editorial decisions here - it may be useful to only show groundhogs with 20 years of predictions, for instance. If you make such decisions, please explain why.\n\nYour charts must have appropriate axis labels and titles.\n\n### Do different groundhogs have different probabilities of predicting 6 more weeks of winter?\n\n```{}\n\n```\n\nI mapped ... to x and ... to y because...\n\n### How much do North American groundhogs tend to agree on their predictions? \nDoes there appear to be any spatial covariance (that is, are groundhogs who are close together more likely to predict the same thing?)\n\n```{}\n\n```\n\n\nI mapped ... to x and ... to y because...\n\n\n## Ugly Chart Challenge\n\nThe textbook spent lots of time showing you how to create different types of graphics, but I spent a lot less time showing you all of the different ways you could customize graphics in any plotting library. In this problem, I want you to create the *ugliest* graph you can, and then **explain why**, exactly, you made the decisions you did, and which principles of good graphics you've intentionally violated. \n\nUgliness is subjective, so the goal here is for you to explore the different ways you can customize the finer details of a plot. \nMake sure your finished masterpiece has appropriate axis labels and a title (after all, even ugly plots need to be correctly labeled!). \nYou are free to add additional variables and layers, modify the aesthetics used, and leverage other packages. \n[If you need inspiration, look here.](https://www.allisonhorst.com/post/do-your-worst/)\n\n\nUse the groundhog data to create the ugliest chart you possibly can, by violating as many guidelines for the creation of good graphics as possible. \n\nDo this for one plotting system in R, and one plotting system in Python.\nYou might try different ways to make things ugly in each plotting system.\nNote that this dataset does include images of each groundhog, so feel free to leverage that in your plot, if you are so inspired.\n\nFor each plot, explain *why* the plot is ugly and what principles of good graphics it violates in 2-3 sentences. \n\n\n\n### R\n\n::: {.cell hash='05-graphics-groundhogs_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-1_8ac5478abe7c28fdadbf4332cfa2c5ec'}\n\n:::\n\nThis chart is ugly because it violates ...\n\n\n### Python\n\n::: {.cell hash='05-graphics-groundhogs_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-2_f2029776f8a9ae2bbecdc98af1b21c08'}\n\n:::\n\n\nThis chart is ugly because it violates ...\n\n",
