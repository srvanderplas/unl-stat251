Grammar of graphics - probabilities and grammar of graphics - agreement are worth 1.5 points each. Ugly chart in R is worth 2.5 points, including the explanation of why the chart is ugly. Ugly chart in python is worth 2.5 points, including the explanation of why the chart is ugly.\"}\n\n# Next time\n\n- Continue working on homework assignment\n\n- Brainstorming: &#x1F9E0;&#x26C8;&#xFE0F;\n    - how to make the textbook &#x1F4D6; more effective \n    - what will motivate you to read it before class? &#x1F61C;\n",
