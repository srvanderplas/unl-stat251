# Brainstorming &#x1F9E0;&#x26C8;&#xFE0F;

- What will make the textbook &#x1F4D6; more useful to you?
    - audiobook version
    - videos embedded in the textbook
    - ...?
- What will motivate you to read it before class? &#x1F61C;

Grammar of graphics - probabilities and grammar of graphics - agreement are worth 1.5 points each. Ugly chart in R is worth 2.5 points, including the explanation of why the chart is ugly. Ugly chart in python is worth 2.5 points, including the explanation of why the chart is ugly."}

# Next time {.r-fit-text}

  - What are the characteristics of tidy data?
  - What verbs do you use to:
      - get a subset of the rows of a data frame?
      - get a subset of the columns of a data frame?
      - add or transform variables?
      - group a data frame by one variable for computations?
      - summarize a data frame?
  - Work through the [Try It Out section at the end of the chapter](https://srvanderplas.github.io/stat-computing-r-python/part-wrangling/03-data-cleaning.html#try-it-out---data-cleaning) before class
