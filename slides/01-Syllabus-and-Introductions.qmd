## Outline  {.scrollable .smaller}
Subject to change based on the events of the semester...

```{r, echo = F}
class_days %>% select(date, topic, time) %>%
  mutate(time = ifelse(is.na(time), "", time)) %>%
  mutate(date2 = format(date, "%b %e")) %>%
  set_names(c("date", "Topic", "Time", "Date")) %>%
  select(Date, Topic) %>%

## Academic Integrity Policy {.r-fit-text}

- You may (should!) work with each other on homework assignments

- Work alone on exams

- You must be able to explain anything you submit    
[At my discretion, I can use a one-on-one discussion of your work to replace the grade for that work.]{.smaller}

- ChatGPT, StackOverflow, Google are tools, but they do not help you think
