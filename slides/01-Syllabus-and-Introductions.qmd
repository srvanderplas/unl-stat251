## Course Objectives

1. Use appropriate visualizations to explore and assess data and its applicability to a problem 

2. Write code to reshape and reformat moderately complex and/or messy data in a reproducible manner

3. Create graphical displays to explore data, assess statistical models, and present model results 

4. Adapt pre-existing code for sophisticated visualizations to new data.

5. Implement an algorithm or procedure for data modification given in pseudocode 

6. Write pseudocode to describe and document modifications made to the dataset

7. Access documentation and source code to determine how software works (or why it doesn't)

8. Identify problems in a dataset that limit the analyses which are appropriate for the data

## Class Schedule

```{r echo = F, message = F, warning = F}
source("../schedule.R")
class_cal
```
## Outline

Subject to change based on how much of Stat 151 you are already familiar with...

```{r, echo = F}
class_days %>% select(date, topic, time) %>%
  mutate(time = ifelse(is.na(time), "", time)) %>%
  mutate(date2 = format(date, "%b %e")) %>%
  set_names(c("date", "Topic", "Time", "Date")) %>%
  select(Date, Time, Topic) %>%
  filter(row_number() <= 10) %>%
kableExtra::kable(caption = "Tentative schedule of class topics", format = "simple")
```

## Academic Integrity / Submitted Work Policy

- You may (and should!) work with each other on homework assignments

- Work alone on exams

- You must be able to explain the logic of anything you submit for a grade    
At my discretion, I will evaluate the coherence of your explanation instead of your submitted work

- ChatGPT, StackOverflow, Google are all valuable tools, but they do not help you think
